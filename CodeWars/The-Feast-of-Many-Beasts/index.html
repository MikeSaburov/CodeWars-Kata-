    <h1>The Feast of Many Beasts</h1>

    <p>
      All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish.
      There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters
      as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic
      naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments
      and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to
      bring the dish to the feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has
      at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but
      these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not
      contain numerals.
